                    HyperText Markup Language - a standardized way of combining plain content 
                    (e.g. text) with <dfn>markup</dfn>, information meant to describe the plain
                    content's role and appearance as opposed to being displayed literally.

                <dt>Tag</dt>
                <dd>
                    A kind of markup used in HTML. At a minimum, a tag consists of "angle brackets"
                    (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>) surrounding an alphanumeric name.
                    A tag tells the browser to create a corresponding HTML element whose
                    name matches the specified type.
                </dd>
                <dt>Element</dt>
                <dd>
                    An object created by the browser to correspond to an HTML tag.
                </dd>
                <dt>Attribute</dt>
                <dd>
                    An optional property of an element.

                <dd>
                    An overarching term that means an element, comment, or plain text inside

            <h2>Document Structure</h2>
            <p>
                An HTML document consists of a set of nested nodes which form a tree structure.
                Just like in 
                <a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=8&coid=31594">Data Structures</a>, 
                the document contains a root element with zero or more child nodes. In a HTML
                document tree, a node can be an element, comment, or plain text. Comments and
                plain text can only be leaf nodes, while elements can either be leaves or
                intermediate nodes.
            </p>
            <section id="examples">
                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <p>
                    A sub-tree where a paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) element has one text node child:
                    <pre class="language-html">
    &lt;p&gt;
        This is a paragraph with nothing but a single text node.
    &lt;/p&gt;
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A sub-tree where an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) has two list item
                    (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) children, each of which have a text node:
                    <pre class="language-html">
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;a list item with a text node&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;another list item with a text node&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A sub-tree where a paragraph has a mix of text and elements as children. In this
                    case, the text is split into two separate nodes by the element between them.
                    <pre class="language-html">
    &lt;p&gt;
        a text node &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a second text node
    &lt;/p&gt;
                    </pre>

                <h3>Inclusion restrictions</h3>
                <p>
                    Not all kinds of elements are allowed to appear in all parts of an HTML document
                    tree. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The root element must be <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>.</li>
                        <li>
                            <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> can only have one 
                            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and one
                            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> as children.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some elements can only appear in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, such as
                            <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. Others can only appear in
                            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. A few, such as <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>,
                            can appear in either.
                        </li>
                        <li>Some elements can only have a single text child, such as <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>.</li>
                        <li>Some elements cannot have any children, such as <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>.</li>
                        <li>Some elements are allowed to have only specific types of elements as children.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Browsers are sometimes more flexible than the rules defined in the HTML standard. For example, the
                    previous paragraph contains an unordered list, even though the paragrapgh element is only supposed
                    to allow <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#phrasing-content-2">phrasing content</a>
                    (see <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/grouping-content.html#the-p-element">the specification</a> 
                    for the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element). Just like how most people will understand if you say something
                    close to but not "proper" English (e.g. using "me" in place of "I" or vice-versa), browsers will understand
                    if you do something close to but not technically correct. However, be aware that some incorrect element 
                    combinations will result in the browser interpreting your HTML in unexpected ways or ignoring those 
                    elements entirely.
                </p>
                <p>Note: comments are allowed inside pretty much any other element that can have child nodes.</p>

            <h2>HTML elements</h2>
            <p>
                A HTML element has three components - type, attributes, and children. A webpage will represent an element
                using a tag, as described under <a href="#key-terms">Key Terms</a>. There are two patterns for writing tags -
                either a combination of an open tag and close tag, or with a self-closing tag. The <a href="#examples">examples</a>
                above all show open + close tags, whereas something like <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"/&gt;</code> is an example
                of a self-closing tag. The type and attributes will always appear inside an open tag or self-closing tag. Children 
                appear between open and close tags. Self-closing tags cannot contain children. Outside of a few exceptions, you 
                will always use open + close for elements with children and self-closing for elements without.
            </p>
            <section>
                <h3>Attributes</h3>
                <p>
                    Attributes are like member variables or a map/dictionary that contains properties of an element. Attributes let
                    us specify behavior and/or visual aspects of HTML elements. The links contained in this page are an example of
                    specifying behavior - each <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag contains an attribute called "href" that says where the 
                    browser should navigate to when the user clicks on the link. Other attributes might affect both function and 
                    appearance, such as the "disabled" attribute you can add to a button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attributes all have a name, and most match a name to a value. It's permissible to specify just a name, in which
                    case the attribute automatically uses an empty string as its value. This is useful for some attributes where the
                    browser does something based on the presence of the attribute alone. For example, the following behave the same,
                    but the first one is more compact:
                    <div><button disabled>Don't click me</button> <code class="language-html">&lt;button disabled&gt;Don't click me&lt;/button&gt;</code></div>
                    <div><button disabled="true">Don't click me</button> <code class="language-html">&lt;button disabled="true"&gt;Don't click me&lt;/button&gt;</code></div>                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attributes for which you want to specify a non-default value have an equals sign (=) followed by the value,
                    optionally in quotes. While it's valid to say <code>width=80</code> or <code>align=left</code>, any value with
                    whitespace or characters that the browser might interpret as part of the tag (", ', &lt;, etc.) won't work
                    correctly without being enclosed in quotes. I recommend using double quotes ("") as a default, even for numbers
                    and booleans. Browsers will still know the target data type and consistency makes it easier to errors in the event
                    you do need quotes.

                <h3>Common inclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    There are a few elements and attributes that it is common to include for clarity to either the user or their
                    software:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> as the very first line of the webpage</dt>
                    <dd>Tells the browser that it's reading HTML, as opposed to plain text, an image, etc.</dd>
                    <dt><code>lang="en"</code> (or whatever language code is appropriate) in <code>&lt;html&gt;</code></dt>
                    <dd>Tells screen readers what language they should read the contents of the document in.</dd>
                    <dt><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code> inside of <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Tells the browser that the document uses the UTF-8 character set (as opposed to ASCII or any
                        other language-limited character set). I always recommend declaring and using UTF-8 both so you can
                        handle multiple human languages in your website and for special symbols like math operators or emoji ⇒ 😎

                    In other languages you may be used to the idea of <dfn>escaping</dfn> control characters. For example, if you have a 
                    Java or C++ string that contains a double quote (e.g. "\"free\" pizza"), you would need to put a backslash before
                    the quote is part of the string, not the end of the string. The same concept applies to HTML - there are some
                    characters like &lt; that you need to escape so that the browser knows you want to display a &lt; rather than
                    starting a tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The HTML way of escaping characters is to use some short name for the character between an ampersand (&amp;) and
                    semicolon (;). If you look at the source code for this page, you'll see a lot of these scattered throughout. Even
                    in this paragraph, I had to type <code>&amp;amp;</code> in order to make the ampersand appear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More generally, you can use this technique to refer to any character. While some characters have special names
                    (amp, lt, gt, quot, apos), you can always refer to a character using its Unicode number. For example, 
                    <code>&amp;#x1F642;</code> will translate to &#x1F642; based on the <code>#x</code> indicating that the
                    following is a hexidecimal number and <code>1F642</code> being the Unicode code for slightly smiling face. Of course, if you
                    declare your charset to be UTF-8 you can type/paste the equivalent in directly 🙂
