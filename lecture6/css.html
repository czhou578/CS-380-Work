                <h2>CSS Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It was invented as a compliment to HTML
                    so that authors could customize the appearance of their webpages and make that
                    appearance consistent across different browsers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS is a <em>declarative</em> language, meaning that instead of telling the 
                    browser exactly what to do (which we do in imperative languages like JavaScript)
                    we give it rules to follow and it figures out the outcome.
                </p>

            <article id="syntax">
                <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS generally takes the following form:
                    <pre class="lang-css">
selector {
    property: value;
}
                    </pre>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>selector</dt>
                        <dd>Tells the browser which elements we want to change the style of.</dd>
                        <dt>property</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Tells the browser what quality of that element we want to change, such as
                            text color, background color, how much space to put around the element, etc.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>value</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Tells the browser what we want to set the property to, such as a specific
                            color, a certain amount of space, a certain font style, etc.
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    You can combine multiple <code>property: value;</code> rules in one set of braces 
                    ({}) and they will all apply to the elements targeted by the selector.

                <h2>Common Properties</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a huge number of CSS properties, many of which have niche uses
                    or specific elements to which they apply. For a comprehensive list, see the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#index" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN reference</a>.
                    Below are a list of common or particularly useful properties you should know.
                </p>
                <article id="properties-colors">
                    <h3>Colors</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways to specify values for color properties. It's
                        common to see #RGB or #RRGGBB values specified on websites that list
                        color values, but some of the alternatives may make sense for
                        specific use cases.

                    <article>
                        <h4>Property formats</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Six hexidecimal digits, such as <code>#003D79</code> (the 
                                nav bar background color). Each pair of digits represents
                                how much red, green, and blue to include, respectively. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Three hexidecimal digits, such as <code>#0F0</code> (pure
                                green). This is easy-to-use shorthand for six digits;
                                <code>#FAB</code> becomes <code>#FFAABB</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A color name, such as <code>black</code>. Browsers have a wide
                                but limited number of color names, so make sure you use a name
                                that they all recognize.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The <code>rgb()</code> function. This takes three arguments that
                                represent red, green, and blue as integers between 0 and 255.
                                Works like six digit hexidecimal format.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The <code>rgba()</code> function. This works just like 
                                <code>rgb()</code> except that it takes a fourth argument, called
                                the <em>alpha</em> value. Alpha can be a decimal value between 0
                                and 1.0. It represents how transparent the color should be, i.e.
                                how much it blends with the color behind it.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h4>Uses</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>background</code>/<code>background-color</code></li>
                            <li><code>color</code> (used for text)</li>
                            <li><code>border</code>/<code>border-color</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, you can use a color as an input to one of the
                            gradient functions, such as <code>linear-gradient()</code>.
                            The gradient functions can be used in some places where basic
                            colors can, such as <code>background</code> to blend multiple
                            colors together, as seen in this example:
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <figcaption>
                                Code for a color gradient. The code block itself uses the
                                CSS rule to give itself a rainbow-colored background.
                            </figcaption>
                            <pre id="rainbow">

        red,
        orange,
        yellow,

        indigo,
        transparent 77%
    );

                            Can be used to set how thick the letters in the text are.
                            Often used to make bold text, but some fonts have a range
                            of thicknesses, represented in multiples of 100 from 100
                            to 800 (normal typically being 400).

                            for simple underlines or something fancy like 
                            <span class="spelling-error">spelling errors</span>.

                            or <code>center</code> to place spare space on each line to
                            the right, the left, or evenly on both sides, respectively.
                            Note: if you might end up handling languages that read from
                            right to left, you may want to consider the difference between
                            values such as <code>left</code> which forces left alignment vs.
                            values such as <code>start</code> which forces alignment to

                <h2>Selectors</h2>
                <p>
                    Selectors are how you define which elements should receive a set of
                    style rules.
                </p>
                <article>
                    <h3>Selector Types</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are a few different types of CSS selectors:
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Type</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Type selectors use the name of a HTML tag to apply a style
                            to all tags with that name. For example,
                            <code class="lang-css">h1 { color: 'darkgray'; }</code> will
                            apply the color to all <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Class</dt>
                        <dd>
                            You can add the "class" attribute to any HTML element as another
                            way to select elements with CSS. In your CSS, you add a dot/period
                            before the name of the class. Example: if you have an element
                            <code>&lt;div class="important"&gt;</code> and some CSS
                            <code class="lang-css">.important { font-weight: bold; }</code>
                            then the div will have bold text.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Id</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Id selectors work just like classes, except that you are only
                            supposed to have one element in your entire page with a given id,
                            whereas you can apply a class to as many elements as you like.
                            In CSS, an id selector uses the hash/pound symbol (#) instead of
                            a dot/period.
                        </dd>

                        <dd>
                            The browser allows you to create some elements purely out of CSS.
                            These are called <dfn>pseudo-elements</dfn>. For example, if you
                            want to add some extra styling or content before or after an
                            exisitng element, you can use 
                            <code class="lang-css">:before</code> or 
                            <code class="lang-css">:after</code>. These aren't particularly
                            common, but you can use them to add extra characters, symbols,
                            or images before or after elements you defined in your HTML.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Pseudo-class</dt>
                        <dd>
                            While you have to apply classes directly to elements using the
                            "class" HTML attribute, there are some classes that the browser
                            automatically applies to some elements. These are called
                            <dfn>pseudo-classes</dfn>. Examples include 
                            <code class="lang-css">:hover</code> for when the user's cursor
                            is over the element or <code class="lang-css">:nth-child()</code>
                            to select a specific element or subset of elements within the
                            same parent element. Pseudo-classes always begin with a colon (:).
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Attribute</dt>
                        <dd>
                            You can also select elements by specifying that they must have an
                            attribute with a specific value. For example,
                            <code class="lang-css">input[type="text"]</code> will only apply to
                            input elements with a HTML attribute of "type" that's equal to "text"
                            (<code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> but not 
                            <code>&lt;input type="checkbox"></code> or <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>).
                            There are several variations that let you specify a prefix, suffix,
                            regular expression, or other attributes. Attribute selectors are
                            surrounded by square brackets ([]).

                    <h3>Combining Selectors</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can use mutliple selectors together to make more specific selectors.
                        You can combine multiple of the same type or mix different types.
                        Here are the different ways in which you can combine them:
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Adjacent</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Putting two selectors together with nothing between them will
                            act like a logic AND. For example, 
                            <code class="lang-css">div.important</code> will only apply to
                            elements with a type of div <em>and</em> a class of "important".
                            You can can combine multiples of any selector type this way
                            except for type (an element cannot have more than one type).
                            Example:
                            <code class="lang-css">a#foo.bar.baz:visited[href^="http"]</code>.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Space-separated</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Adding whitespace between selectors says that you're looking for
                            an element that's a descendant of another element. For example,
                            <code class="lang-css">p a</code> will apply to any a
                            elements that are children, grandchildren, etc. of a p.
                            You can chain multiple selectors with spaces, e.g.
                            <code class="lang-css">body #bonus article .info</code>.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Greater than (&gt;)</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Adding a greater than symbol between selectors (with or without
                            whitespace) says that you're looking for an element that's a 
                            direct child of another element. For example,
                            <code class="lang-css">ul.small > li</code> will apply to any
                            list items <em>directly</em> inside unordered lists with the
                            "small" class, but not to list items that are in sub-lists.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Plus (+) and Tilde (~)</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Work like greater than, but between siblings, or in other words
                            two children of the same element. The plus sign means that the
                            browser should only look for a elements that are directly next
                            to each other, whereas the tilde means that the second element
                            just has to come after the first element (there can be others
                            in between them). For example,
                            <code class="lang-css">.main + .alt</code> will apply to any
                            elements with the class "alt" that are immediately after an
                            element with the class "main" within the same parent, while
                            <code class="lang-css">.main ~ .alt</code> will apply to any
                            elements with the class "alt" that are somewhere after an
                            element with the class "main" within the same parent. In the
                            following HTML, the plus operator applies to just the first
                            "alt", while the tilde applies to all following "alt"s.
                            <pre>
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div class="main"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="alt"&gt;Liz&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="alt&gt;Beth&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
                            </pre>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <aside>
                        Note: there are no ways to select a parent or a previous sibling,
                        only ways to go down or forwards in the tree of elements.

                    <h3>Specificity</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the case of conflicting styles, browser will prefer whichever
                        style came from the more <dfn>specific</dfn> selector. The specificity
                        of a selector is a score that the browser gives based on the parts
                        that make up the selector. You can think of it like a comparator or
                        a key function that you would use to sort a list in Java, Python, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are the rules for which style the browser selects:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Any style defined on the HTML element itself using the
                            <code>style</code> HTML attribute.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any style rule with <code class="lang-css">!important</code> on it.
                            Note that this applies to each property, not a selector:
                            <pre>
.my-style {
    padding: 4px;
    color: green !important;
}
                            </pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any style that comes from a selector with an id in it. More ids take
                            priority over fewer ids, although there's normally no reason for more
                            than one id.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If two selectors have the same number of ids, then whichever one has
                            more classes, pseudo-classes*, or attribute selectors. One of each would
                            win over two classes, but two classes and two attribute selectors would
                            win over one of each or three classes or two classes and one pseudo-class,
                            etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If two selectors have the same number of ids and classes, then whichever
                            one has more types or pseudo-elements. For example, 
                            <code class="lang-css">ul > li</code> will win over <code class="lang-css">li</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If two selectors have the same number of ids, classes, and types, then
                            whichever one was read last by the browser. The browser will always load
                            its own default stylesheet first, which is why even if you use a selector
                            like <code class="lang-css">a</code> which would tie the default, yours
                            loads second so it overwrites the default.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <aside>
                        *The <code class="lang-css">:not()</code> pseudo-class does not add to
                        the specificity score. <code class="lang-css">li:first-child</code> and
                        <code class="lang-css">li:not(:first-child)</code> have the exact same
                        specificity score.

                <h2>Size measurements</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS provides several ways to specify size values:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>px</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Pixels. While this used to mean the smallest individual changeable
                        part of the monitor, small devices will underreport the number of
                        pixels in their display so things don't appear tiny on them. While
                        your phone may actually have a higher resolution than your laptop,
                        it will typically report a much lower width or height in pixels.
                        Regardless, px is a common default unit of measurement for sizes.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>%</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Percent. This defines the width of the element relative to the size
                        of the nearest block element ancestor.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>em</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Represents the size of one capital letter M in the element's font
                        size.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>vw/vh</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Viewport width/height. Similar to percent, but relative to the
                        <em>viewport</em>, i.e. the whole visible portion of the page.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    There are several other measurements that refer to physical sizes,
                    such as <code>cm</code> for centimeters, <code>in</code> for inches,
                    or <code>pt</code> for points (the sizing used in Mircosoft Word).
                    These measurements are typically used for printable material; for
                    web pages we use pixels instead.

                <h2>The Box Model</h2>
                <p>
                    When rendering HTML elements onto the screen, the browser surrounds each
                    element with a rectangle/box. The rectangle allows the browser to make sure
                    that elements don't overlap (unless we tell it to do that explcitly). It
                    also lets us customize the size of the element and the space around it.
                    The logic and the CSS properties that govern these boxes are collectively 
                    known as the <dfn>box model</dfn>.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> the box model only applies to <em>block</em> elements, 
                    such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or elements with a CSS 
                    <code class="lang-css">display</code> property that makes it a block
                    (more on that in a later section). Any <em>inline</em> elements will instead
                    contribute to the box belonging to their nearest block ancestor.
                </aside>
                <section>
                    <h3>Box Model Layers</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to give us more fine-grained control over spacing, the box
                        around each element has several layers that we can size individually.
                        I call these layers because each successive one surrounds the prevous.
                        Going from inside to outside, the layers are: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>Content</li>
                            <li>Padding</li>
                            <li>Border</li>
                            <li>Margin</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Content is the innermost layer. The content box will default to fitting
                        the text, images, inline children, etc. contained within the element.
                        However, you can use the CSS <code class="lang-css">width</code> and
                        <code class="lang-css">height</code> properties to set the size of
                        the content box (unless you set the CSS property 
                        <code class="lang-css">background-clip</code>; see below).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Padding surrounds the content. It allows you to add space between the
                        content and the border. By default, padding will have the same background
                        as the content. For an example, see the bottom of this page &dash; there's
                        64px worth of space with the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>'s background color
                        below where the content ends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The border goes around the padding. Borders are essentially a line that
                        the browser draws around the padding box. You can specify how wide the
                        line is, what drawing style the browser should use (solid, dashed, 
                        dotted, etc.), and what color to draw it with. There are separate CSS
                        properties for each of these, or the combined 
                        <code class="lang-css">border</code> property that sets all three at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The border is where the background of the element ends. Even if you don't
                        specify a border directly, the browser will act as if you have a 0px wide
                        border surrounding the padding. This is relevant when you specify the 
                        <code class="lang-css">border-radius</code> property. Even if you don't give
                        an element a border, the border radius will still round the corners of the
                        background.
                    </p>

                        <figcaption>
                            A div with a border radius. The curve of the border defines where
                            the background ends, even when the border itself is transparent.
                        </figcaption>

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Finally, margin goes on the outside of the border. It works much like padding
                        except that it does not include the element's background.

                    <h3>Blocks and the Display Property</h3>
                    <p>
                        As noted above, the box model only applies to block-level elements. Some 
                        elements such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will default to being block-level,
                        while other elements will default to being <em>inline</em>, such as
                        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>. You can override this behavior using the CSS
                        property <code class="lang-css">display</code>. In addition to choosing
                        block or inline behavior, there's an in-between value of
                        <code class="lang-css">inline-block</code>. The differences are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <code class="lang-css">block</code> will separate the element 
                                from the previous and following elements by putting it on its 
                                own line. The browser will apply any box model properties to
                                the element.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code class="lang-css">inline</code> will put the element on the 
                                same line as the previous and following elements. The browser 
                                will ignore any box model properties of inline elements (width, 
                                padding, etc.).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code class="lang-css">inline-block</code> will put the element on
                                the same line as the previous and following elements like it does
                                with inline, but the browser will apply any box model properties 
                                like it does with block.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Box Model Modifiers</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are several properties that can override the default behavior of
                        the box model as described above. The most common one I've seen is
                        <code class="lang-css">box-sizing</code>, which changes which layer
                        of the box model is affected by <code class="lang-css">width</code>
                        and <code class="lang-css">height</code>. 
                        border-box-example allows you to choose between
                        the default of <code class="lang-css">content-box</code> and the
                        alternative of <code class="lang-css">border-box</code>, the latter of
                        which will make the size properties affect the content, padding, and
                        border combined.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>
                            An example of <code class="lang-css">box-sizing: content-box</code>.
                            Each element has a width of 25%, but because that does not include the
                            border the four elements become wider than their parent.
                        </figcaption>
                        <div class="box-sizing-example">
                            <div>1</div><div>2</div><div>3</div><div>4</div>
                        </div>
                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption>
                            An example of <code class="lang-css">box-sizing: border-box</code>.
                            Each element has a width of 25%. Unlike the previous example, this size
                            does include the border, so they all fit on one line.
                        </figcaption>
                        <div class="box-sizing-example border-box-example">
                            <div>1</div><div>2</div><div>3</div><div>4</div>
                        </div>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The other notable change you can make to the box model rules is with
                        <code class="lang-css">background-clip</code>. This property changes how
                        far the background extends. By default, it will extend to the edge of the
                        border, which means that if you have a transparent border with > 0 width
                        (example: <code class="lang-css">border: 2px solid transparent;</code>)
                        then the background will extend that width. By changing the background
                        clip you can set it to only match the padding or content box.
